# Not-Space-Invaders
This is a basic python game made using Pygame as its main base for image/animation creation. It was made as a challenge to myself for the final project in my Grade 12 level Comp Sci course. 

I had made it within a business week (5days) while going into it with no knowledge of python. It can be apparant in some respects that it was made in a short timespan by someone new to the language, but it did recieve a 97%  final grade.   

It was made using "Pycharm" IDE, so if there are issues running it, it may be due to being used in an unfamiliar development enviroment.  

Feel free to make forks off of it if you have any interest.
